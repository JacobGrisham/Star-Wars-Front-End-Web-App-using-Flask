### Homework from [Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science CS50 hosted on eDX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)
### 🎓 [Web Track](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/)
- [Homepage](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/homepage/): Tasked to build a simple homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I took this as an opportunity to go beyond this by practicing design and using advanced CSS mehtods.

## 💡Lessons Learned
- Wireframing and Prototyping in AdobeXD
- Mobile-first design
- Building Front-End from Design Specs
- SVG code in-line within HTML (and when to use src file reference instead)
- SVG in place of heavy CSS
- SVG animations
- Advanced CSS properties
- Deploying a Flask application on Heroku
- Git branch management
